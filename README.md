# üì¶ SupplyCast‚Ñ¢: A Dual-Pipeline AI System for Sales Forecasting & Supply Chain Prediction

**By Empress Ruler of All Kingdoms üëë | Powered by Shams ‚òÄÔ∏è, Samaa üåå, and Dune üåµ**

## üß† Overview

SupplyCast‚Ñ¢ is a modular machine learning framework built to predict **product demand** and **optimize supply chains** ‚Äî across any industry.

Originally developed for a fictional Algerian yogurt brand (*Laitinelle Dairies‚Ñ¢*), this system can adapt to different products like shoes, makeup, cleaning products, and more.

> Forecast demand like a prophet. Optimize stock like a supply chain oracle. üîÆ

## üîç What This Project Does

### ‚úÖ **Sales Forecasting Pipeline**
- Predicts **future product demand** (e.g., yogurt units sold).
- Uses features like:
  - `date`
  - `promotion`
  - `temperature` (optional, product-specific)
  - `units_sold`

### ‚úÖ **Supply Chain Prediction Pipeline**
- Uses predicted sales + inventory + delivery delays to optimize stock.
- Answers questions like:
  - How much to reorder?
  - When will stock run out?
  - Are we at risk of overstock or stockout?

> These two pipelines are separate but interlinked. Sales forecast is **fed** into the supply chain model to guide smart inventory decisions.
